  - Received “Teammates I Can Count On to Win” award in recognition of metrics improvements.
  - Improved change failure rate by 50%, lead time (time it takes for a pipeline to complete successfully) by 25%, and mean time to recovery (time from a failing execution until the next passing run) by 125% of the Jenkins pipeline over a period of six months.
  - Setup monitoring and alerting of automation infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana.
  - Fulfilled SAFe Product Owner duties, including defining and maintaining backlog of features, stories and bugs.
